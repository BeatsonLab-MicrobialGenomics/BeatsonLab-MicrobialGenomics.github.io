I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Evolutionary Biology and Biomedical
Science from the University of Queensland. I did my Honours research project at
QIMR with Prof. Michael Good on the role of regulatory T-cells in the immune
response to Malaria. From 2008 until 2010 I worked as a research technician in
Transgene Silencing and Stability Group within the Plant Molecular Improvement
Laboratory with Prof. Robert Birch and Dr. Dr Michael Graham at the The
University of Queensland. I have been working in Dr Beatsonâ€™s lab since
February 2010. My project centres on the evolutionary adaptation of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa to the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.
