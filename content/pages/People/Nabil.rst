====================

My PhD project falls into the area of pathogenomics, which uses genomic data
from high throughput sequencing technologies to understand the diversity of
microbes and the factors driving the evolution and virulence of pathogens.

My project focuses on one particular pathogen, Shiga toxin producing *E. coli*
(STEC), a food-borne pathogen that has been responsible for a number of
outbreaks, including the German O104:H4 outbreak in 2011 with 4,200 people
infected across the World and 50 deaths.

Within my project, I am comparing whole genome sequencing of non-O157 STEC
associated with human disease and attempting to understand the genomic
variation between these strains and evolutionary mechanisms that created these
variants.

By studying these areas, I can hopefully contribute to a greater understanding
of these bacteria, which would eventually allow us to develop better detection
and targeting methods to remove these bacteria from our produce and protect us
from infection.

Pathogenomics is a relatively new field of science and poses challenges in how
we effectively analyse and visualise data from en masse whole genome
sequencing.

As such, I've been developing tools and software to address these challenges,
most notably the BLAST Ring Image Generator (BRIG). BRIG is a tool for
visualising whole genome comparisons. BRIG has been actively maintained and 
supported since publication and has been used in 40 papers and downloaded over 
3,800 times.
