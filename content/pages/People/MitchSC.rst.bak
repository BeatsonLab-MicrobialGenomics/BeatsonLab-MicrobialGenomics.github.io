Mr Mitchell Stanton-Cook
========================

Mitchell’s studies at the University of Queensland resulted in a Bachelor of
Science (Bioinformatics) and a Honours degree (Biochemistry). Mitchell’s spent
time in the lab of Dr Thomas Huber based at the Australian National
University. Here he looked at computing protein interactions and dynamics
from paramagnetic nuclear magnetic resonance data. Mitchell has since moved 
from a niche field in structural bioinformatics to the exciting realm of 
sequence bioinformatics. At present, he’s the groups system 
administrator/programmer and manages our next-generation sequencing (ngs) 
datasets. His work involves developing solutions for the efficient storage, 
processing and analysis of ngs datasets.

He loves linux, writes a fair bit of Python code and can handle himself in
a high performance computing environment.
