lab during the advent of next-generation sequencing. His role involved
designing protocols for assembling genomes for collaborators of the group.

Mitchell stayed with the Beatson group to undertake his postgraduate studies,

assemblies.

In his spare time Mitchell enjoys listening, playing and composing music. He
