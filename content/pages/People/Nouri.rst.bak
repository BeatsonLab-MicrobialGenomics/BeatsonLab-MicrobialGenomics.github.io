Dr Nouri L Ben Zakour
=====================

My interests range from population genetics and evolutionary genomics to
functional genomics, to understand how pathogenic streptococci and
staphylococci evolve to colonize new ecological niches. Most of my projects
involve the characterization of large strains collections, and focus not solely
on evolutionary and epidemiological questions, but also on more applied
questions, with industry partneurships involving risk factors surveillance and
therapeutic targets mining using reverse vaccinology.
