Scott Beatson an Associate Professor and group leader at The University of Queensland. He is based in the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences and is a member of the Australian Infectious Diseases Research Centre.  Together with a talented team of microbiologists and bioinformaticians has developed a research program that exploits Next-Generation Sequencing data to investigate the evolution and virulence of medically important bacterial pathogens.

He trained as a molecular microbiologist at the Universigy of Otago (Masters, 1996-1997) and the University of Queensland (PhD, 1998-2001) before undertaking postdoctoral fellowships in Bioinformatics at the University of Oxford (2001-2003) and the University of Birmingham (2003-2005). In 2006 he returned to the University of Queensland as an NHMRC Howard Florey Research Fellow. In 2008 he was awarded an ARC Australian Research Fellowship that enabled him to establish the Microbial Genomics Group at UQ. He currently holds a Career Development Fellowship from the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia entitled "Bacterial Pathogenomics: whole-genome sequencing to investigate infection transmission, pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance".
