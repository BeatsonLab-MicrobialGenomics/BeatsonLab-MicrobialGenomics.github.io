Mr Mitchell Stanton-Cook
========================

Mitchell’s studies at the University of Queensland resulted in a Bachelor of
Science (Bioinformatics) and a Honours degree (Biochemistry). Mitchell’s spent
time in the lab of Dr Thomas Huber based at the Australian National
University. Here he looked at computing protein interactions and dynamics
from paramagnetic nuclear magnetic resonance data. Mitchell has since moved 
from a niche field in structural bioinformatics to the exciting realm of 
sequence bioinformatics. At present, he’s the groups system 
administrator/programmer and manages our next-generation sequencing (ngs) 
data sets. His work involves developing solutions for the efficient storage, 
processing and analysis of ngs data sets.

He loves linux, writes a fair bit of Python code_ and can handle himself in
a high performance computing environment.

Mitchell is a Software Carpentry (SWC_) Instructor. He's leading the a workshop 
in July_.

In 2015 he'll be helping to organise HealthHack_ in Brisbane.

You can find Mitchell's publication record here_. He also spends a fair bit 
of time on twitter_ and has a personal blog_.
