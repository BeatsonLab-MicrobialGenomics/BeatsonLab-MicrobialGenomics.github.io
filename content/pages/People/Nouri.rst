Dr Nouri L Ben Zakour
=====================

<<<<<<< HEAD
I am a senior post-doctoral researcher specialised in Microbial and Evolutionary Genomics, working in the Beatson Lab, at the Australian Infectious Diseases Research Centre, University of Queensland since 2009. In 2002, I was awarded a PhD scholarship of Excellence of the French Ministry of Research to do a PhD in Bioinformatics at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research with Dr Yves Le Loir, on the bacterial genome variability of Staphylococcus aureus. In 2006, I moved to Scotland to hold a postdoctoral position at the University of Edinburgh, working with Prof Ross Fitzgerald on the genomic basis of host adaptation in staphylococcal species. Late 2009, I joined Dr. Scott Beatson’s Microbial Genomics Group at the University of Queensland, to expand my research to other bacterial pathogens of medical and veterinary importance. 

My interests range from population genetics and evolutionary genomics to functional genomics, to investigate bacterial outbreaks, and more fundamentally, understand how pathogenic bacteria evolve to colonize new ecological niches. My work focuses not solely on evolutionary and epidemiological questions, but also on more applied issues such as risk factors surveillance, and therapeutic targets mining.

In my spare time, I enjoy travelling, photography, kayaking, scuba diving and archery. True to my French roots, I also have a passion for (good) food.
