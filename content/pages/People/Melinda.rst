Melinda Ashcroft
================

I completed my undergraduate degree (BAsc) approximately 10 years ago at the Queensland University of Technology majoring in Biotechnology and Biochemistry. I then spent 7 years working in a different career, before returning to postgraduate study and obtained my Master of Biotechnology from the University of Queensland in 2013. I have conducted 2 minor thesis projects as part of the Masters course. The first project focused on chemical irritant induced, skin inflammation in a molecular biology laboratory with the second project focused on transcription factors in melanoma in the Beatson bioinformatics laboratory. Additionally, I was awarded two summer research scholarships. The first focused on metabolic engineering of industrial and pharmaceutical isoprenoids in microbes in the Australian Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, with the second focused on data manipulation of the E. coli methylome again in the Beatson laboratory. I then spent 3 months volunteering in the Beatson lab part-time working on a statistical analysis of the E.coli methylome.

My PhD project started in May 2014 in the Beatson lab and will be focusing on the evolution and function of methyltransferases in pathogenic E. coli. I will be working on genomic and epigenomic analyses incorporating RNASeq analysis and phylogenomics.

Additionally in my spare time I am involved in the running of the UQ Molecular Biotechnology Students Club (Facebook) and enjoy science communication and blogging, social media, fantasy and sci-fi fiction, gaming and AFL.
