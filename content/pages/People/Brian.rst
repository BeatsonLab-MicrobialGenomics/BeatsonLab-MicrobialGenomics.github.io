Dr Brian Forde
==============

My interests lie in whole genome assembly, comparative genomics and genome-wide methylome analysis of bacterial genomes 
to understand the mechanisms of virulence and antibiotic resistance in *E. coli*. 
Currently my work involves the uses of PacBio SMRT sequencing technology to explore the genomes of multidrug 
resistant *E. coli* and developing methodologies for dealing with this datatype.
