==============

I am pursuing a career in science as a researcher. I began with studying
infectious diseases and they continue to hold my interest to this day. However,
I have also grown to appreciate the complexity and power of the genome and how
it influences the characteristics of the organism it belongs to. My research
areas are in microbiology, molecular biology, bioinformatics and computational
biology. I am also interested in branching out into eukaryotic organisms,
proteomics and cancer research.
