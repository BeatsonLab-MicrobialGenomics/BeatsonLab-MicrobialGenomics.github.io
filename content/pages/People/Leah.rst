I completed my undergraduate degree in Science/Arts at the University of Queensland in 2013, majoring in Microbiology (infectious disease) and Japanese. I was awarded the 2013 UQ Microbiology prize, and have participated in several introductory research experiences with Dr Ulrike Kappler, Assoc Prof James Fraser and Dr Scott Beatson.

I am currently completing my Honours in Microbiology in the Scott Beatson lab, focusing on the role of insertion sequences in the recently emerged *Escherichia coli* ST131 lineage. My interests lie in epidemiology and the study of disease outbreaks, as well as in education and science communication.
