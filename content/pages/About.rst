The Beatson group aims to better understand the molecular mechanisms of
infectious disease and identify potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets by
exploiting “Next-gen” genomic data. A major focus of the group is the
comparative analysis of genomes obtained from local clinical isolates of
important human pathogens such as *Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Staphylococci, Streptococci, Legionella pneumophila* and *Acinetobacter
baumannii*. In particular, the group is interested in the evolution and
mobility of genes encoding virulence factors that are widely conserved amongst
bacterial pathogens (e.g. fimbriae, pili and type III and type IV secretion
systems and secreted effectors). World-wide there are thousands of bacterial
genome and meta-genome projects in progress, but the bottle-neck remains data
analysis. A major priority in the group is the development of bioinformatics
software to effectively utilize Next-gen sequence data.

Current projects range from researching fundamental questions such as “how has
*Escherichia coli* pathogenesis evolved?” and "how are genes transferred 
between bacteria?" to the identification of potential diagnostic and vaccine 
targets and the development of software tools to enable integrated analysis of 
100’s or 1000’s of bacterial genomes. 


Recent research highlights
--------------------------

**Escherichia coli ST131**

In April 2014 we had a large scale study of *E coli* ST131 published_ in PNAS. 
We wrote a `blog post`_ about the importance of this study. Both `UQ News`_ 
and `7 News`_ presented a news articles about this study. The data is 
available on GitHub_.
