The Beatson Group Research Aims
===============================

The Beatson group aims to better understand the molecular mechanisms of
infectious disease and identify potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets by
exploiting “Next-gen” genomic data. A major focus of the group is the
comparative analysis of genomes obtained from local clinical isolates of
important human pathogens such as *Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Staphylococci, Streptococci, Legionella pneumophila* and *Acinetobacter
baumannii)*. In particular, the group is interested in the evolution and
mobility of genes encoding virulence factors that are widely conserved amongst
bacterial pathogens (e.g. fimbriae, pili and type III and type IV secretion
systems and secreted effectors). World-wide there are thousands of bacterial
genome and meta-genome projects in progress, but the bottle-neck remains data
analysis. A major priority in the group is the development of bioinformatics
software to effectively utilize Next-gen sequence data.

Current projects range from researching fundamental questions such as “how has
*Escherichia coli* pathogenesis evolved?” and "how are genes transferred 
between bacteria?" to the identification of potential diagnostic and vaccine 
targets and the development of software tools to enable integrated analysis of 
100’s or 1000’s of bacterial genomes. 

The Beatson group work closely with other local and international molecular 
microbiologists and clinicians particularly Prof Mark Schembri (UQ), 
Prof Mark Walker (UQ), Prof Elizabeth Hartland (UMel), Dr Mat Upton 
(Manchester), Prof Ian Henderson (Birmingham) and Prof David Gally (Edinburgh).


About Scott Beatson
-------------------

Scott Beatson obtained a PhD in 2002 for his work on Pseudomonas aeruginosa
genomics and pathogenesis with Prof John Mattick and Dr Cynthia Whitchurch at
The University of Queensland. Previously he completed a BSc and MSc in
Microbiology at the University of Otago, New Zealand. As a postdoctoral
researcher he was awarded fellowships to study genomics at the University of
Oxford (UK) with Prof Chris Ponting and at the University of Birmingham (UK)
with Prof Mark Pallen. Since moving to the School of Chemistry & Molecular
Biosciences in 2006 he has combined his interests in genomics and bacterial
infectious diseases to establish the UQ Bacterial Pathogenomics research group.
