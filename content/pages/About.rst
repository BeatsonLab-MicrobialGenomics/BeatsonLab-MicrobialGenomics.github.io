The Beatson group aims to better understand the molecular mechanisms of
infectious disease and identify potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets by
exploiting “Next-gen” genomic data. We aim to exploit next-generation DNA sequencing 
to better understand how medically important bacteria cause disease, become resistant 
to antibiotics and disseminate globally. Our major focus is the role of mobile genetic 
elements in the evolution of virulence and antimicrobial resistance amongst pathogens 
such as *Escherichia coli*, *Streptococcus pyogenes*, and *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. Our 
group develops new computational approaches for the rapid analysis of bacterial genome 
data from the latest sequencing technologies. 

Current projects range from researching fundamental questions such as “how has
*Escherichia coli* pathogenesis evolved?” and "how are genes transferred 
between bacteria?" to the identification of potential diagnostic and vaccine 
targets and the development of software tools to enable integrated analysis of 
100’s or 1000’s of bacterial genomes. 

Recent research highlights
--------------------------

**NHMRC Funding**

Congratulations to Dr Scott Beatson on being awarded a Level 2 NHMRC Career 
Development Fellowship. The project was titled "Bacterial Pathogenomics: 
whole-genome sequencing to investigate infection transmission, pathogenesis 
and antibiotic resistance". A total of $455 452 was awarded and will begin 
in 2015.


**Complete genome of representative ST131 strain**

We determined the complete genome sequence of Escherichia coli EC958: a high 
quality reference sequence for the globally disseminated multidrug resistant 
E. coli O25b:H4-ST131 clone. We used a 3rd generation sequencing technology, 
PacBio SMRT sequencing to determine this genome and associated plasmids. 
We declare that "Large discrepancies between ST131 genomes are likely due to 
misassembly of E. coli NA114". [Link_] 


**Escherichia coli ST131**

In April 2014 we had a large scale study of *E coli* ST131 published_ in PNAS. 
We wrote a `blog post`_ about the importance of this study. Both `UQ News`_ 
and `7 News`_ presented a news articles about this study. The data is 
available on GitHub_.
